# CCFácil
Simple software with GUI to format plain text to SRT.

The process is easy: We write down the perfect version of the speech, inform its duration and then it generates an .srt file that can be imported to an NLE video editor. Sometimes we still need to fix the timing by hand but the task of copying/pasting small portions of the text, one by one is no more! CCFácil is reliable, it handles many problems a text can have in captioning (starting too soon, long words, new lines, maximum characters by line, remove double spaces), and creates every block of CC with the time proportional to the number of characters. And of course it has a face (an User Interface with nicet UX), because it's for human beings.
